 A basic model of a neural network system built from scratch.
- Network training and testing based on mnist (60k+10k images). Layout: 28(width)* 28(height) x 16 x16 x 10(output numbers from 0 to 9). Expected result for this system: 90-92% - achieved. Time for one full training and testing(70k images): 5 min 20s
